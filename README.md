## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SCSS
- Javascript

### What I learned

### Continued development

It felt all over the place when I started this project. I still felt the website I made was constricted, and not dynamic enough. For further development, I will try to make it can add new message/activity.
